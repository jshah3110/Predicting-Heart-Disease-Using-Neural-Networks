# Predicting-Heart-Disease-Using-Neural-Networks
This project focuses on predicting heart disease using neural networks based on features such as blood pressure, cholesterol levels, heart rate, and other characteristic features.

# Next Steps
The next step would be to deploy this project using the StreamLit library to get an interactive user interface and host it using Heroku.
